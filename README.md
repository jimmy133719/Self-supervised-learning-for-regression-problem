# Self-supervised-learning-for-regression-problem

### Motivation
Verify the usefulness of self-supervised learning for regression problem

### Required package
- numpy
- matplotlib
- torch

### Run
```
python ssl_regression.py
```

### Result
From this toy experiment, we verify that self-supervised learning can boost the performance of neural network on regression task.
